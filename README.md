### Project Overview

The waste water management project aims to monitor and optimize the treatment and disposal of wastewater in USA. The project involves multiple wastewater treatment plants, sources of waste water across various locations. The main objective is to ensure efficient treatment of wastewater.

### Data Sources

- Source: The dataset used for this analysis is the "Source.csv" file,containing the information about each source of the waste water. 
- Treatment plant: The dataset used for this analysis is the "Treatment plant .csv" file,containing the information about each Treatment plant. 
- WasteWaterTreatmentFact: The dataset used for this analysis is the "WastrWaterTreatmentFact.csv" file,containing the result of the wastewater treatment. 

### Tool
python - Data cleaning, Data Analysis, Creating Report

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the intial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling null values
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the waste water treatment management data to answer key questions, such as:

-Which plant is treating the maximum and minimum volume of wastewater?
-What is the percentage contribution of wastewater from different sources?
-Which treatment plant is the most highly utilized?
-Which treatment plant is the most highly efficient?
-What is the day-wise activity of the treatment plant?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with:
- '''WstWtrtrt_TrtPlant_df_grouped =WstWtrtrt_TrtPlant_df.groupby('name',as_index=False)['Volume of Water Treated'].sum()'''

- '''fig=px.bar(WstWtrtrt_TrtPlant_df_grouped.sort_values(by='Volume of Water Treated',ascending=False),x='name',y='Volume of Water Treated',template='plotly_dark',color='name',text='Volume of Water Treated')
- fig.update_layout(xaxis_title='Treatment Plant Name',yaxis_title='VOlume of Waste Water Treated (million gallons)',title=dict(text='Total Volume of Waste Water Treated by Different Treatment Plants',x=0.5),width=1000)
fig.show()'''

- '''Weekday_wise_Activity_df=WstWtrtrt_TrtPlant_df.groupby(['name','Weekday'],as_index=False)['Volume of Water Treated'].sum()'''

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Los Angeles Treatment Plant is treating highest volume of water.
   - Sacramento Treatment Plant is treating lowest volume of water.
- Healthcare and Industrial Sector is generating almost equal % of waste water.
- Los Angeles Treatment Plant is maximum utilized.
- Denver Treatment Plant is highly efficient.
- Almost same volume of waste water is treated everyday by different plants.
  - For San Diego : Maximum volume of waste water is treated on Friday & Minimum volume is treated on Monday.


### Recommendations

Recommendations based on data analysis to optimize wastewater treatment processes, minimize resource consumption, and enhance overall efficiency.

### Risks
1. Data Quality and Availability: The risk of incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data could impact the reliability and validity of the analytics outcomes. Inefficient data collection procedures or data integration challenges could hamper project chances of success.
2. Protection of Data: Dealing with confidential wastewater data requires rigorous data security measures. Inadequate data protection practices, unauthorized access, or data breaches could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of the data, leading to legal and reputational risks.
3. Interpretation and Decision-making: The interpretation of analytics results requires expertise and understanding of context. Misinterpretation of data, biases, or incorrect decision-making could lead to ineffective outcomes.
4. Budget & Resource Constraints: Insufficient resources, both financial and human, could impact the project's scope, timeline, and quality.
